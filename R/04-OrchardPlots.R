#### PLOTS - ORCHARD PLOTS?
####    PANEL A - Main effect for synchrony, showing no global relationship 
####              between site location (urban/rural) and laying date CV. Also
####              add random effects points for species, showing some species 
####              with obvious positive/negative responses
####    PANEL B - Main effect for number of fledglings, showing fewer fledged
####              when laying date CV is higher. Points showing this is a nearly
####              universal effect for all species, suggesting that if species
####              are responding differently to cues in urban/rural environments
####              this could affect their repro success; some species that become
####              more synchronous in cities may have an advantage, while those
####              becoming less synchronous will have a disadvantage. Add random
####              effects points for species, showing almost all species have 
####              negative response.
