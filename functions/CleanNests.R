# Takes the list of all cities, finds the species-year combinations with â‰¥ 10
# nests, and then calculates the coefficient of variation for the nests. If
# there is an imbalance in the number of rural/urban nests for a species-year
# combination, the one with more nests is subsampled so the sample sizes are
# equal.
